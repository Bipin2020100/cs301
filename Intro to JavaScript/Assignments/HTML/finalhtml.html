    Hello World. My name is Bipin Regmi.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/"> facebook </a> You can also call me Bips. I
    am someone who wants to try things myself rather
    than listing to other people opinions. I always want to learn something new, something tuff , fail at it and get
    back
    up again. This attitude in me is very helpful for me because I think this is the only way I can discover my true
    passion and work on that for the rest of my life. I am a very positive person who is always seeking for improvement.
    I
    love working on myself to make me a better human being every next day.

    In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and the
    Goblet of Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide Harry’s future for him, depriving him
    of freedom and choice. For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s life, keeping from
    him knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter and the Chamber of
    Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and Hermione’s letters during the
    summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts Express; and by sending a
    Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. Yet again, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
    Azkaban, many adults intercede while attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger, as Snape observes: “Everyone
    from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All
    these characters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive Harry toward his destiny by attempting to control or to
    direct his life, while themselves controlled and directed by fate.

    It’s perhaps not surprising that Marshall McLuhan, the most influential communications expert of the twentieth
    century, was a Canadian. As a nation, we have been preoccupied with forging communication links among a sparse,
    widespread population. The old Canadian one-dollar bill, with its line of telephone poles receding to the distant
    horizon, illustrates this preoccupation. Year after year we strive to maintain a national radio and television
    broadcasting system in the face of foreign competition. We have been aggressive in entering the international high
    technology market with our telecommunications equipment.
